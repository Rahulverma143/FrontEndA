  -> JavaScript has eight basic data types that are used to classify values. These data types are categorized into primitive and non-primitive types. 
   1. Primitive Data Types:
i) Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
ii) String: Represents textual data enclosed in single or double quotes.
iii) Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.
iv) Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
v) Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value. 
vii) BigInt: Represents integers of arbitrary precision, exceeding the limits of the Number type.
viii) Symbol: Represents unique and immutable values, often used as object keys. 
   2. Non-Primitive Data Type:
 -> Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, allowing for more complex data structures.
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime and can change during the execution of the program.
