   ->  Variables in JavaScript are containers used for storing data values. They are essential for holding information that can be referenced and manipulated within a program.


    ->   Declaration: 
 -> Variables are declared using the keywords var, let, or const. 
1. var: This keyword declares a variable with function-scoped or globally-scoped behavior. It allows redeclaration and reassignment. 

2. let: Introduced in ES6, this keyword declares a block-scoped variable. It does not allow redeclaration within the same scope but permits reassignment.
  -> The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)
  -> Variables declared with let have Block Scope
  -> Variables declared with let must be Declared before use
  -> Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope
3. const: This keyword declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.
  -> The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)
  -> Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared
  -> Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned
  -> Variables defined with const have Block Scope
-> Assignment:
    Values are assigned to variables using the equal sign (=).
